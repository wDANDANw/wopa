test_server_health.py

This test file implements the T-Services-Server-Health-001 test case and related checks.

**Purpose:**
T-Services-Server-Health-001 aims to verify the basic availability and correct response structure
of the main server endpoints in the services subsystem. Specifically:
- /admin: The admin UI endpoint should be accessible and return an HTTP 200 status, 
  ideally showing some UI structure (mocked).
- /configs: The endpoint should return the current configuration in JSON format.
- /tasks: The endpoint should list current tasks and worker status, even if mocked or empty.

**Design & Approach:**
- We use pytest and fastapi.testclient to simulate requests to the FastAPI app created by service_manager.py.
- Since this is a unit test, if service_manager depends on external objects, they will be mocked.
- We rely on a fixture that returns a TestClient linked to the FastAPI app. This fixture can be placed 
  in a conftest.py or defined in this file for simplicity.
- The test checks HTTP status codes (expected 200) and minimal response structure. Actual data might 
  be mocked for unit testing since we are not integrating external services.

**Prerequisites:**
- The service_manager.py defines a FastAPI app with endpoints: /admin, /configs, /tasks
- Gradio UI or HTML content at /admin might be minimal or mocked.
- The /configs and /tasks endpoints return JSON (mock data).

**Success Criteria:**
- GET /admin returns 200 and contains some identifiable UI element (e.g. a placeholder string 'gradio' or HTML)
- GET /configs returns 200 and JSON with expected keys (e.g., at least a dict)
- GET /tasks returns 200 and JSON with a list or dict representing tasks (empty or not)

By passing these checks, we confirm that the server endpoints are healthy and basically functional.

**Maintainability Notes:**
- Keep the test simple and focused.
- If endpoint structures change, update the expected keys or placeholders accordingly.
- Document any mocks at the top of the test functions.
- Use descriptive test function names that correlate with the tested endpoint.
