**Test File: T-Services-Logging-006**

**Purpose:**
Verify that the services subsystem logs relevant information during operation. Logging is key for maintainability, 
debugging, and transparency. We need to ensure:
- Errors and exceptions are logged at ERROR level.
- Warnings or unexpected conditions are logged at WARNING or INFO.
- Normal operations may log INFO-level entries for startup or config load.

**Context:**
- The services subsystem uses Python logging. Typically, logging might occur in `service_manager` when endpoints are called,
  or in services when validation fails, fallback occurs, or worker results are invalid.
- We'll mock the logger or set a custom logging.Handler to capture logs and assert that certain actions produce expected log messages.

**Design & Approach:**
- Use `pytest` and `logging` libraryâ€™s capabilities.
- Replace or wrap the logger with a MemoryHandler or a mock object, then perform operations that should produce logs.
- After the operation, check captured log records for expected messages and levels.

**Scenarios to Test:**
1. Invalid input triggers an ERROR log entry.
2. Fallback scenario triggers a WARNING or ERROR log.
3. Successful request may log INFO about processing steps.
4. Config load at startup logs INFO about loaded services.

Since this is a unit test, we can simulate these conditions by calling service methods or endpoints with mocked conditions 
and verifying logs.

**Prerequisites:**
- The service_manager or services must contain `logging` calls at appropriate points.
- If actual code is not implemented yet, we can assume certain log calls or just check a minimal scenario.
- If needed, we can patch `logging.getLogger` or a specific logger instance and capture output.

**Success Criteria:**
- Correct log levels and messages appear in the log output when performing actions like invalid input submission or fallback triggering.

This is the last test file. After this, we start implementation.

    T-Services-Logging-006-PartB

    Purpose:
    Trigger a fallback scenario and ensure it logs at WARNING or ERROR level.

    Steps:
    - If we have a known fallback scenario (like calling a service that triggers fallback),
      we must replicate it. We can do it by mocking a worker endpoint to fail.
      Since it's a unit test at endpoint level, we might rely on previous fallback tests scenario:
      Perhaps call /analyze/link with a known URL that triggers fallback. 
      If fallback logic not directly testable, we can mock again. Here we trust fallback scenario is triggered by
      certain input or a previously known condition.

    For demonstration, let's assume that passing a special URL "http://fallback-test.com"
    triggers fallback in the service_manager logic. We must have code that tries calling a worker and fails.

    We can't code logic here since no actual code yet, let's just rely on no external code:
    We'll do a simple call that we know from previous tests triggers fallback:
    Maybe mocking the relevant method from `fallback_service` as done before.
    We'll patch `_call_next_worker` from the fallback scenario.

    Success Criteria:
    A WARNING or ERROR log indicating fallback occurred.

"""
Additional Notes:
- Each test is heavily commented.
- We simulate various scenarios: invalid input (error logs), fallback scenario (warning/error), normal operation (info logs), config load (info).
- Mocks and assumptions used where needed since actual code isn't implemented yet.
- If actual logging messages differ, update asserts to match actual code messages.
- This ensures logging coverage and maintainability, so developers can rely on logs for debugging.

This is the last test file. After this, we can start our implementation.
