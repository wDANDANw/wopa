This file implements tests for T-Services-Worker-Workflow-003.

**Test Case: T-Services-Worker-Workflow-003**

**Purpose:**
We want to verify that the service’s internal worker workflow logic is correct. This includes:
- Registering workers (with input/output schemas)
- Deregistering workers if needed
- Calling workers in a defined sequence using `_call_next_worker()`
- Validating each worker's result against the expected output schema using `_validate_results()`
- Aggregating all results into a final report via `_aggregate_at_service_level()`

We do this at a unit test level, without external integration:
- All worker calls will be mocked to return predefined responses.
- We'll use a mock subclass of `BaseService` or a real service that registers workers in `__init__`.

**Design & Approach:**
- Create a test fixture that sets up a mock service extending `BaseService`.
- This mock service registers two workers: "text_analysis" and "link_analysis" with known schemas.
- We'll simulate a scenario:
  1. Register two workers.
  2. Process a "task_data" dict by calling these workers in sequence.
  3. Validate intermediate and final results.
- Test various conditions: correct worker output, invalid worker output, deregistering a worker and ensuring it’s no longer available.

**Prerequisites:**
- `BaseService` and its methods are defined and can be imported.
- A mock or real service class we can instantiate for tests.
- Mocks for `_call_next_worker()` results.

**Success Criteria:**
- Workers are successfully registered and stored internally.
- `_call_next_worker()` correctly retrieves worker info, calls the mock, and returns a result.
- `_validate_results()` passes on correct schemas, fails on incorrect ones.
- `_aggregate_at_service_level()` merges multiple worker outputs into a final dict.
- If a worker is deregistered, attempting to call it fails gracefully.

"""
Additional Notes:
- Each test function has detailed docstrings explaining purpose and steps.
- We used mocks to control worker outputs and test the logic purely at the unit level.
- If schema changes or workflow changes, update tests accordingly.
- The tests show how the service orchestrates multiple workers based on conditions (confidence).
- This ensures maintainability: 
  * If new workers are added or naming changes, just adjust register/deregister and tests.
  * If schemas get more complex, update _validate_results() checks and corresponding tests.
- The parameterized test shows how we can easily add more schema variations.

By passing these tests, we confirm that the worker workflow logic in the service is robust and correct.
