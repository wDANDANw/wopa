# test_integration_llm.py
#
# Purpose:
# Integration tests verifying the interaction between the Worker Module's text 
# worker and the actual LLM endpoint in the Providers subsystem.
#
# Design & Steps:
# 1. Run the Providers subsystem that includes LLM endpoint: /llm/inference
# 2. The Worker Module (workers container) should be running with real endpoints, 
#    no mocks. We rely on docker-compose for this scenario.
# 3. Send tasks to /request_worker with a text-type payload.
# 4. Expect real LLM classification responses, ensuring that the Worker Module 
#    properly processes them.
# 5. Test normal scenarios (phishing text) and error scenarios (e.g., LLM returns 
#    non-200 status or malformed JSON if such a scenario can be triggered).
#
# Maintainability:
# - If LLM response schema changes, update parsing logic in TextAnalysisWorker 
#   and these tests to reflect new expected outcomes.
# - If we add additional text-related features or require confidence thresholds,
#   modify the test assertions accordingly.
#
# Testing:
# - Run `make test-integration-workers` or a similar command that sets MODE=test 
#   and TEST_MODE=integration in a docker-compose environment that spins up providers.
# - If tests fail, check logs from both worker and providers containers to diagnose.
