# test_integration_tasks_lifecycle.py
#
# Purpose:
# Integration tests verifying the complete lifecycle of tasks:
# 1. Enqueue a task via /enqueue_task (e.g., a text or link task).
# 2. Potentially at a later time, request immediate processing via /request_worker 
#    or rely on some future logic (if implemented) to process enqueued tasks.
# 3. Verify that once processed, tasks appear in /tasks and /get_worker_results 
#    endpoints with completed status and results from real provider endpoints.
#
# This simulates a scenario closer to how the Worker Module might be used in 
# production, ensuring that initial steps (enqueuing) and final retrieval 
# (get_worker_results) work seamlessly under real conditions.
#
# Design & Steps:
# 1. Use `enqueue_task` to enqueue a known task (e.g., {"type":"text","content":"test scenario"}).
# 2. Store returned task_id.
# 3. Use `request_worker` with a similar or the same task_data to simulate processing 
#    that task. In a real scenario, we might have a separate mechanism to pick enqueued 
#    tasks and process them, but for now, we rely on immediate processing for integration tests.
# 4. Check /tasks to list known tasks, ensuring our task_id is present with 'completed'.
# 5. GET /get_worker_results?task_id=... to confirm final result details.
#
# Maintainability:
# - If future updates handle enqueued tasks differently (e.g., a separate endpoint 
#   or worker that processes the queue asynchronously), adapt tests accordingly.
# - If result schemas change (e.g., more fields in result), update assertions.
#
# Testing:
# - Run `make test-integration-workers` with MODE=test and TEST_MODE=integration 
#   after ensuring Providers services are running.

        Purpose:
          Test a text task from enqueue to process and final retrieval.

        Steps:
          1. POST /enqueue_task with {"type":"text","content":"Hello integration"}
             Expect {"task_id":..., "status":"enqueued"}.
          2. Use /request_worker with a similar text scenario. Actually, since integration
             might not have a separate queue processor implemented, we call /request_worker 
             directly to simulate immediate processing of a similar or same input. 
             In a real system, we might need a future method or just rely on the 
             immediate processing scenario for now.
          3. Check /tasks to ensure the newly processed task_id appears with "completed".
          4. GET /get_worker_results?task_id=... to confirm final result details.

        Success:
          The task moves from enqueued to completed, final results reflect LLM classification.

    # task_id instead of updating the enqueued one. If the full lifecycle requires 
    # the same task_id to show completed in get_worker_results, WorkerManager/store_result 
    # logic might need revisiting or we may need a separate endpoint to run enqueued tasks.
    #
    # For now, this test demonstrates how we check the presence of completed tasks and final results 
    # but acknowledges that the current implementation assigns a fresh task_id on immediate processing.

    # If in future we implement a queue worker that picks up enqueued tasks and processes them, 
    # we can adapt this test to wait for that logic or poll /tasks until the enqueued task_id is completed.
