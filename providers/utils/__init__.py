# __init__.py
#
# Purpose:
# This file marks the `utils` directory as a Python package.
# Without this file (in Python versions before 3.3), the directory wouldn't 
# be recognized as a package. In modern Python, `__init__.py` is often optional,
# but it's still a common practice to include it.
#
# Key Responsibilities:
# - Turn `utils` into a package that can be imported as `from utils import config_loader`.
# - Optionally include package-level imports or initialization code, though not required here.
#
# Requirements:
# - None. This file can be empty or just contain comments.
#
# Maintainability:
# - If we need to add package-wide initialization (like setting a global logger),
#   we could place it here. For now, itâ€™s empty, focusing on simple package structure.

# Currently no code needed, just a placeholder.
# Future enhancements could include:
# - Global log configuration for utils package.
# - Conditional imports if certain dependencies are optional.
#
# For now, leave empty.
